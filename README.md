# X-Ember-CLI

This is a tool that corrects, or modifies the behavior of the ember-cli. It utilizes the ember-cli as a peer-dependency, using it underneath to provide the bulk of the desired functionality

Use this the same way as the ember-cli unless for anything stated otherwise, in which case follow the specific instructions to reach the desired outcome

## STATUS AND NOTE
This will fail for everything where an overwrite is to be expected, and also wherever you need to run the destroy command of ember-cli

In this cases, use the ember-cli

This is for now only meant to be used for non-destructive creation commands
